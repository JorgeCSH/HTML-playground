# HTML playground

## About this repo

For a long time, I have had basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. However, over the last year, my interest in web development has grown. To progress and learn tools like JavaScript and the different frameworks it has, I needed to refine my skills in HTML and CSS and improve them to a more professional level. This repository contains some of the projects (some of them may seem trivial) I have worked on to enhance my abilities.

## Index

1. github-readme: This directory contains a version of my GitHub README created with HTML. It's a basic version that I started with. While the original is in a markdown file, recreating it with HTML and CSS was (and still is, depending on the time) a personal goal.  

2. Still cooking.

## Afterwords

This repository is intended to help me improve my skills. If, for some reason, you come across it and have any suggestions, feel free to share them with me, I’d be happy to hear them. My skills may not be the best right now, but I believe I’m making progress.
